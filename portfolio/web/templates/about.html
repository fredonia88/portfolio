  This project is hosted on AWS EC2 and uses a RDS Postgres database for storage. It is deployed via Docker featuring a webserver 
  and nginx proxy server. The project is entirely custom; the backend is built in Python using Django as the web framework, 
  and the front end is built in Javascript, HTML and CSS.
